Problem
Write a program that displays the first 50 prime numbers in five lines, each of which contains 10 numbers.
Algorithm
An integer greater than 1 is prime if its only positive divisor is 1 or itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are prime numbers, but 4, 6, 8, and 9 are not
If a number is not divisible by any number preceding it (except 1) without remainder, it is a prime number. For example, 5 is not equally divisible by 4, 3, or 2, so 5 is a prime number
Output
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29
31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71
73 79 83 89 97 101 103 107 109 113
127 131 137 139 149 151 157 163 167 173
179 181 191 193 197 199 211 223 227 229
